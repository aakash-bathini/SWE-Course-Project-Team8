Gemma\nmodels are well-suited for a variety of text generation tasks, including\nquestion answering, summarization, and reasoning. Their relatively small size\nmakes it possible to deploy them in environments with limited resources such as\na laptop, desktop or your own cloud infrastructure, democratizing access to\nstate of the art AI models and helping foster innovation for everyone. \n\n### Context Length\nModels are trained on a context length of 8192 tokens.\n\n### Usage\n\nBelow we share some code snippets on how to get quickly started with running the model.

To adapt it to this model, simply change the model-id to `google/gemma-2b`.\nIn that repository, we provide:\n\n* A script to perform Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on UltraChat dataset using QLoRA\n* A script to perform SFT using FSDP on TPU devices\n* A notebook that you can run on a free-tier Google Colab instance to perform SFT on English quotes dataset\n\n\n\n#### Running the model on a CPU\n\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM\n\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"google/gemma-2b\")\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\"google/gemma-2b\")\n\ninput_text = \"Write me a poem about Machine Learning.\"\ninput_ids = tokenizer(input_text, return_tensors=\"pt\")\n\noutputs = model.generate(**input_ids)\nprint(tokenizer.decode(outputs[0]))\n```\n\n\n#### Running the model on a single / multi GPU\n\n\n```python\n# pip install accelerate\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM\n\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"google/gemma-2b\")\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\"google/gemma-2b\", device_map=\"auto\")\n\ninput_text = \"Write me a poem about Machine Learning.\"\ninput_ids = tokenizer(input_text, return_tensors=\"pt\").to(\"cuda\")\n\noutputs = model.generate(**input_ids)\nprint(tokenizer.decode(outputs[0]))\n```\n\n\n#### Running the model on a GPU using different precisions\n\n* _Using `torch.float16`_\n\n```python\n# pip install accelerate\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM\n\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"google/gemma-2b\")\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\"google/gemma-2b\", device_map=\"auto\", revision=\"float16\")\n\ninput_text = \"Write me a poem about Machine Learning.\"\ninput_ids = tokenizer(input_text, return_tensors=\"pt\").to(\"cuda\")\n\noutputs = model.generate(**input_ids)\nprint(tokenizer.decode(outputs[0]))\n```\n\n* _Using `torch.bfloat16`_\n\n```python\n# pip install accelerate\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM\n\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"google/gemma-2b\")\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\"google/gemma-2b\", device_map=\"auto\", torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16)\n\ninput_text = \"Write me a poem about Machine Learning.\"\ninput_ids = tokenizer(input_text, return_tensors=\"pt\").to(\"cuda\")\n\noutputs = model.generate(**input_ids)\nprint(tokenizer.decode(outputs[0]))\n```\n\n#### Quantized Versions through `bitsandbytes`\n\n* _Using 8-bit precision (int8)_\n\n```python\n# pip install bitsandbytes accelerate\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM, BitsAndBytesConfig\n\nquantization_config = BitsAndBytesConfig(load_in_8bit=True)\n\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"google/gemma-2b\")\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\"google/gemma-2b\", quantization_config=quantization_config)\n\ninput_text = \"Write me a poem about Machine Learning.\"\ninput_ids = tokenizer(input_text, return_tensors=\"pt\").to(\"cuda\")\n\noutputs = model.generate(**input_ids)\nprint(tokenizer.decode(outputs[0]))\n```\n\n* _Using 4-bit precision_\n\n```python\n# pip install bitsandbytes accelerate\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM, BitsAndBytesConfig\n\nquantization_config = BitsAndBytesConfig(load_in_4bit=True)\n\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"google/gemma-2b\")\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\"google/gemma-2b\", quantization_config=quantization_config)\n\ninput_text = \"Write me a poem about Machine Learning.\"\ninput_ids = tokenizer(input_text, return_tensors=\"pt\").to(\"cuda\")\n\noutputs = model.generate(**input_ids)\nprint(tokenizer.decode(outputs[0]))\n```\n\n\n#### Other optimizations\n\n* _Flash Attention 2_\n\nFirst make sure to install `flash-attn` in your environment `pip install flash-attn`\n\n```diff\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\n    model_id, \n    torch_dtype=torch.float16, \n+   attn_implementation=\"flash_attention_2\"\n).to(0)\n```\n\n### Inputs and outputs\n\n*   **Input:** Text string, such as a question, a prompt, or a document to be\n    summarized.\n*   **Output:** Generated English-language text in response to the input, such\n    as an answer to a question, or a summary of a document.\n\n## Model Data\n\nData used for model training and how the data was processed.\n\n### Training Dataset\n\nThese models were trained on a dataset of text data that includes a wide variety\nof sources, totaling 6 trillion tokens. Here are the key components:\n\n* Web Documents: A diverse collection of web text ensures the model is exposed\n  to a broad range of linguistic styles, topics, and vocabulary. Primarily\n  English-language content.\n* Code: Exposing the model to code helps it to learn the syntax and patterns of\n  programming languages, which improves its ability to generate code or\n  understand code-related questions.\n* Mathematics: Training on mathematical text helps the model learn logical\n  reasoning, symbolic representation, and to address mathematical queries.\n\nThe combination of these diverse data sources is crucial for training a powerful\nlanguage model that can handle a wide variety of different tasks and text\nformats.\n\n### Data Preprocessing\n\nHere are the key data cleaning and filtering methods applied to the training\ndata:\n\n* CSAM Filtering: Rigorous CSAM (Child Sexual Abuse Material) filtering was\n  applied at multiple stages in the data preparation process to ensure the\n  exclusion of harmful and illegal content\n* Sensitive Data Filtering: As part of making Gemma pre-trained models safe and\n  reliable, automated techniques were used to filter out certain personal\n  information and other sensitive data from training sets.\n* Additional methods: Filtering based on content quality and safely in line with\n  [our policies](https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/documents/2023_Google_AI_Principles_Progress_Update.pdf#page=11).\n\n## Implementation Information\n\nDetails about the model internals.\n\n### Hardware\n\nGemma was trained using the latest generation of\n[Tensor Processing Unit (TPU)](https://cloud.google.com/tpu/docs/intro-to-tpu) hardware (TPUv5e).\n\nTraining large language models requires significant computational power. TPUs,\ndesigned specifically for matrix operations common in machine learning, offer\nseveral advantages in this domain:\n\n* Performance: TPUs are specifically designed to handle the massive computations\n  involved in training LLMs. They can speed up training considerably compared to\n  CPUs.\n* Memory: TPUs often come with large amounts of high-bandwidth memory, allowing\n  for the handling of large models and batch sizes during training. This can\n  lead to better model quality.\n* Scalability: TPU Pods (large clusters of TPUs) provide a scalable solution for\n  handling the growing complexity of large foundation models. You can distribute\n  training across multiple TPU devices for faster and more efficient processing.\n* Cost-effectiveness: In many scenarios, TPUs can provide a more cost-effective\n  solution for training large models compared to CPU-based infrastructure,\n  especially when considering the time and resources saved due to faster\n  training.\n* These advantages are aligned with\n  [Google's commitments to operate sustainably](https://sustainability.google/operating-sustainably/).\n\n### Software\n\nTraining was done using [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax) and [ML Pathways](https://blog.google/technology/ai/introducing-pathways-next-generation-ai-architecture/ml-pathways).\n\nJAX allows researchers to take advantage of the latest generation of hardware,\nincluding TPUs, for faster and more efficient training of large models.\n\nML Pathways is Google's latest effort to build artificially intelligent systems\ncapable of generalizing across multiple tasks. This is specially suitable for\n[foundation models](https://ai.google/discover/foundation-models/), including large language models like\nthese ones.\n\nTogether, JAX and ML Pathways are used as described in the\n[paper about the Gemini family of models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11805); \"the 'single\ncontroller' programming model of Jax and Pathways allows a single Python\nprocess to orchestrate the entire training run, dramatically simplifying the\ndevelopment workflow.\"\n\n## Evaluation\n\nModel evaluation metrics and results.\n\n### Benchmark Results\n\nThese models were evaluated against a large collection of different datasets and\nmetrics to cover different aspects of text generation:\n\n| Benchmark                      | Metric        | 2B Params | 7B Params |\n| ------------------------------ | ------------- | ----------- | --------- |\n| [MMLU](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.03300)                   | 5-shot, top-1 | 42.3        | 64.3      |\n| [HellaSwag](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.07830)         | 0-shot        |71.4        | 81.2      |\n| [PIQA](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.11641)                   | 0-shot        | 77.3        | 81.2      |\n| [SocialIQA](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.09728)      | 0-shot        | 49.7        | 51.8      |\n| [BooIQ](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10044)                | 0-shot        | 69.4        | 83.2      |\n| [WinoGrande](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.10641)       | partial score | 65.4        | 72.3      |\n| [CommonsenseQA](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.00937) | 7-shot        | 65.3        | 71.3      |\n| [OpenBookQA](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.02789)       |               | 47.8        | 52.8      |\n| [ARC-e](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.01547)                  |               | 73.2        | 81.5      |\n| [ARC-c](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.01547)                   |               | 42.1        | 53.2      |\n| [TriviaQA](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.03551)           | 5-shot        | 53.2        | 63.4      |\n| [Natural Questions](https://github.com/google-research-datasets/natural-questions)  | 5-shot        | 12.5       | 23        |\n| [HumanEval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.03374)      | pass@1        | 22.0        | 32.3      |\n| [MBPP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.07732)                   | 3-shot        | 29.2        | 44.4      |\n| [GSM8K](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.14168)                | maj@1         | 17.7        | 46.4      |\n| [MATH](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.07732)                   | 4-shot        | 11.8          | 24.3      |\n| [AGIEval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06364)           |               | 24.2        | 41.7      |\n| [BIG-Bench](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.04615)         |               | 35.2        | 55.1      |\n| ------------------------------ | ------------- | ----------- | --------- |\n| **Average**                    |               | **45.0**    | **56.9**  |\n\n## Ethics and Safety\n\nEthics and safety evaluation approach and results.\n\n### Evaluation Approach\n\nOur evaluation methods include structured evaluations and internal red-teaming\ntesting of relevant content policies.

The following list of potential uses is not\ncomprehensive. The purpose of this list is to provide contextual information\nabout the possible use-cases that the model creators considered as part of model\ntraining and development.\n\n* Content Creation and Communication\n  * Text Generation: These models can be used to generate creative text formats\n    such as poems, scripts, code, marketing copy, and email drafts.\n  * Chatbots and Conversational AI: Power conversational interfaces for customer\n    service, virtual assistants, or interactive applications.\n  * Text Summarization: Generate concise summaries of a text corpus, research\n    papers, or reports.\n* Research and Education\n  * Natural Language Processing (NLP) Research: These models can serve as a\n    foundation for researchers to experiment with NLP techniques, develop\n    algorithms, and contribute to the advancement of the field.\n  * Language Learning Tools: Support interactive language learning experiences,\n    aiding in grammar correction or providing writing practice.\n  * Knowledge Exploration: Assist researchers in exploring large bodies of text\n    by generating summaries or answering questions about specific topics.\n\n### Limitations\n\n* Training Data\n  * The quality and diversity of the training data significantly influence the\n    model's capabilities. Biases or gaps in the training data can lead to\n    limitations in the model's responses.\n  * The scope of the training dataset determines the subject areas the model can\n    handle effectively.\n* Context and Task Complexity\n  * LLMs are better at tasks that can be framed with clear prompts and\n    instructions. Open-ended or highly complex tasks might be challenging.\n  * A model's performance can be influenced by the amount of context provided\n    (longer context generally leads to better outputs, up to a certain point).\n* Language Ambiguity and Nuance\n  * Natural language is inherently complex. LLMs might struggle to grasp subtle\n    nuances, sarcasm, or figurative language.\n* Factual Accuracy\n  * LLMs generate responses based on information they learned from their\n    training datasets, but they are not knowledge bases. They may generate\n    incorrect or outdated factual statements.\n* Common Sense\n  * LLMs rely on statistical patterns in language. They might lack the ability\n    to apply common sense reasoning in certain situations.\n\n### Ethical Considerations and Risks\n\nThe development of large language models (LLMs) raises several ethical concerns.\nIn creating an open model, we have carefully considered the following:\n\n* Bias and Fairness\n  * LLMs trained on large-scale, real-world text data can reflect socio-cultural\n    biases embedded in the training material. These models underwent careful\n    scrutiny, input data pre-processing described and posterior evaluations\n    reported in this card.\n* Misinformation and Misuse\n  * LLMs can be misused to generate text that is false, misleading, or harmful.\n  * Guidelines are provided for responsible use with the model, see the\n    [Responsible Generative AI Toolkit](http://ai.google.dev/gemma/responsible).\n* Transparency and Accountability:\n  * This model card summarizes details on the models' architecture,\n    capabilities, limitations, and evaluation processes.\n  * A responsibly developed open model offers the opportunity to share\n    innovation by making LLM technology accessible to developers and researchers\n    across the AI ecosystem.\n\nRisks identified and mitigations:\n\n* Perpetuation of biases: It's encouraged to perform continuous monitoring\n  (using evaluation metrics, human review) and the exploration of de-biasing\n  techniques during model training, fine-tuning, and other use cases.\n* Generation of harmful content: Mechanisms and guidelines for content safety\n  are essential.

Gemma 3 has a large, 128K context window, multilingual support in over\n140 languages, and is available in more sizes than previous versions. Gemma 3\nmodels are well-suited for a variety of text generation and image understanding\ntasks, including question answering, summarization, and reasoning. Their\nrelatively small size makes it possible to deploy them in environments with\nlimited resources such as laptops, desktops or your own cloud infrastructure,\ndemocratizing access to state of the art AI models and helping foster innovation\nfor everyone.\n\n### Inputs and outputs\n\n-   **Input:**\n    -  Text string, such as a question, a prompt, or a document to be summarized\n    -  Images, normalized to 896 x 896 resolution and encoded to 256 tokens\n       each, for the 4B, 12B, and 27B sizes.\n    -  Total input context of 128K tokens for the 4B, 12B, and 27B sizes, and\n       32K tokens for the 1B and 270M sizes.\n\n-   **Output:**\n    -   Generated text in response to the input, such as an answer to a\n        question, analysis of image content, or a summary of a document\n    -   Total output context up to 128K tokens for the 4B, 12B, and 27B sizes,\n        and 32K tokens for the 1B and 270M sizes per request, subtracting the\n        request input tokens\n\n### Citation\n\n```none\n@article{gemma_2025,\n    title={Gemma 3},\n    url={https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19786},\n    publisher={Google DeepMind},\n    author={Gemma Team},\n    year={2025}\n}\n```\n\n## Model Data\n\nData used for model training and how the data was processed.\n\n### Training Dataset\n\nThese models were trained on a dataset of text data that includes a wide variety\nof sources. The 27B model was trained with 14 trillion tokens, the 12B model was\ntrained with 12 trillion tokens, 4B model was trained with 4 trillion tokens,\nthe 1B with 2 trillion tokens, and the 270M with 6 trillion tokens. The \nknowledge cutoff date for the training data was August 2024. Here are the key \ncomponents:\n\n-   Web Documents: A diverse collection of web text ensures the model is\n    exposed to a broad range of linguistic styles, topics, and vocabulary. The\n    training dataset includes content in over 140 languages.\n-   Code: Exposing the model to code helps it to learn the syntax and\n    patterns of programming languages, which improves its ability to generate\n    code and understand code-related questions.\n-   Mathematics: Training on mathematical text helps the model learn logical\n    reasoning, symbolic representation, and to address mathematical queries.\n-   Images: A wide range of images enables the model to perform image\n    analysis and visual data extraction tasks.\n\nThe combination of these diverse data sources is crucial for training a powerful\nmultimodal model that can handle a wide variety of different tasks and data\nformats.\n\n### Data Preprocessing\n\nHere are the key data cleaning and filtering methods applied to the training\ndata:\n\n-   CSAM Filtering: Rigorous CSAM (Child Sexual Abuse Material) filtering\n    was applied at multiple stages in the data preparation process to ensure\n    the exclusion of harmful and illegal content.\n-   Sensitive Data Filtering: As part of making Gemma pre-trained models\n    safe and reliable, automated techniques were used to filter out certain\n    personal information and other sensitive data from training sets.\n-   Additional methods: Filtering based on content quality and safety in\n    line with [our policies][safety-policies].\n\n## Implementation Information\n\nDetails about the model internals.\n\n### Hardware\n\nGemma was trained using [Tensor Processing Unit (TPU)][tpu] hardware (TPUv4p,\nTPUv5p and TPUv5e). Training vision-language models (VLMS) requires significant\ncomputational power. TPUs, designed specifically for matrix operations common in\nmachine learning, offer several advantages in this domain:\n\n-   Performance: TPUs are specifically designed to handle the massive\n    computations involved in training VLMs. They can speed up training\n    considerably compared to CPUs.\n-   Memory: TPUs often come with large amounts of high-bandwidth memory,\n    allowing for the handling of large models and batch sizes during training.\n    This can lead to better model quality.\n-   Scalability: TPU Pods (large clusters of TPUs) provide a scalable\n    solution for handling the growing complexity of large foundation models.\n    You can distribute training across multiple TPU devices for faster and more\n    efficient processing.\n-   Cost-effectiveness: In many scenarios, TPUs can provide a more\n    cost-effective solution for training large models compared to CPU-based\n    infrastructure, especially when considering the time and resources saved\n    due to faster training.\n-   These advantages are aligned with\n    [Google's commitments to operate sustainably][sustainability].\n\n### Software\n\nTraining was done using [JAX][jax] and [ML Pathways][ml-pathways].\n\nJAX allows researchers to take advantage of the latest generation of hardware,\nincluding TPUs, for faster and more efficient training of large models. ML\nPathways is Google's latest effort to build artificially intelligent systems\ncapable of generalizing across multiple tasks. This is specially suitable for\nfoundation models, including large language models like these ones.\n\nTogether, JAX and ML Pathways are used as described in the\n[paper about the Gemini family of models][gemini-2-paper]; *\"the 'single\ncontroller' programming model of Jax and Pathways allows a single Python\nprocess to orchestrate the entire training run, dramatically simplifying the\ndevelopment workflow.\"*\n\n## Evaluation\n\nModel evaluation metrics and results.\n\n### Benchmark Results\n\nThese models were evaluated against a large collection of different datasets and\nmetrics to cover different aspects of text generation. Evaluation results marked\nwith **IT** are for instruction-tuned models. Evaluation results marked with\n**PT** are for pre-trained models.\n\n#### Gemma 3 270M\n\n| **Benchmark**             |  **n-shot**   | **Gemma 3 PT 270M** |\n| :------------------------ |

approach and results.\n\n### Evaluation Approach\n\nOur evaluation methods include structured evaluations and internal red-teaming\ntesting of relevant content policies. Red-teaming was conducted by a number of\ndifferent teams, each with different goals and human evaluation metrics. These\nmodels were evaluated against a number of different categories relevant to\nethics and safety, including:\n\n-   **Child Safety**: Evaluation of text-to-text and image to text prompts\n    covering child safety policies, including child sexual abuse and\n    exploitation.\n-   **Content Safety:** Evaluation of text-to-text and image to text prompts\n    covering safety policies including, harassment, violence and gore, and hate\n    speech.\n-   **Representational Harms**: Evaluation of text-to-text and image to text\n    prompts covering safety policies including bias, stereotyping, and harmful\n    associations or inaccuracies.\n\nIn addition to development level evaluations, we conduct \"assurance\nevaluations\" which are our 'arms-length' internal evaluations for responsibility\ngovernance decision making. They are conducted separately from the model\ndevelopment team, to inform decision making about release. High level findings\nare fed back to the model team, but prompt sets are held-out to prevent\noverfitting and preserve the results' ability to inform decision making.\nAssurance evaluation results are reported to our Responsibility & Safety Council\nas part of release review.\n\n### Evaluation Results\n\nFor all areas of safety testing, we saw major improvements in the categories of\nchild safety, content safety, and representational harms relative to previous\nGemma models. All testing was conducted without safety filters to evaluate the\nmodel capabilities and behaviors. For both text-to-text and image-to-text, and\nacross all model sizes, the model produced minimal policy violations, and showed\nsignificant improvements over previous Gemma models' performance with respect\nto ungrounded inferences. A limitation of our evaluations was they included only\nEnglish language prompts.\n\n## Usage and Limitations\n\nThese models have certain limitations that users should be aware of.\n\n### Intended Usage\n\nOpen vision-language models (VLMs) models have a wide range of applications\nacross various industries and domains. The following list of potential uses is\nnot comprehensive. The purpose of this list is to provide contextual information\nabout the possible use-cases that the model creators considered as part of model\ntraining and development.\n\n-   Content Creation and Communication\n    -   Text Generation: These models can be used to generate creative text\n        formats such as poems, scripts, code, marketing copy, and email drafts.\n    -   Chatbots and Conversational AI: Power conversational interfaces\n        for customer service, virtual assistants, or interactive applications.\n    -   Text Summarization: Generate concise summaries of a text corpus,\n        research papers, or reports.\n    -   Image Data Extraction: These models can be used to extract,\n        interpret, and summarize visual data for text communications.\n-   Research and Education\n    -   Natural Language Processing (NLP) and VLM Research: These\n        models can serve as a foundation for researchers to experiment with VLM\n        and NLP techniques, develop algorithms, and contribute to the\n        advancement of the field.\n    -   Language Learning Tools: Support interactive language learning\n        experiences, aiding in grammar correction or providing writing practice.\n    -   Knowledge Exploration: Assist researchers in exploring large\n        bodies of text by generating summaries or answering questions about\n        specific topics.\n\n### Limitations\n\n-   Training Data\n    -   The quality and diversity of the training data significantly\n        influence the model's capabilities. Biases or gaps in the training data\n        can lead to limitations in the model's responses.\n    -   The scope of the training dataset determines the subject areas\n        the model can handle effectively.\n-   Context and Task Complexity\n    -   Models are better at tasks that can be framed with clear\n        prompts and instructions. Open-ended or highly complex tasks might be\n        challenging.\n    -   A model's performance can be influenced by the amount of context\n        provided (longer context generally leads to better outputs, up to a\n        certain point).\n-   Language Ambiguity and Nuance\n    -   Natural language is inherently complex. Models might struggle\n        to grasp subtle nuances, sarcasm, or figurative language.\n-   Factual Accuracy\n    -   Models generate responses based on information they learned\n        from their training datasets, but they are not knowledge bases. They\n        may generate incorrect or outdated factual statements.\n-   Common Sense\n    -   Models rely on statistical patterns in language. They might\n        lack the ability to apply common sense reasoning in certain situations.\n\n### Ethical Considerations and Risks\n\nThe development of vision-language models (VLMs) raises several ethical\nconcerns. In creating an open model, we have carefully considered the following:\n\n-   Bias and Fairness\n    -   VLMs trained on large-scale, real-world text and image data can\n        reflect socio-cultural biases embedded in the training material. These\n        models underwent careful scrutiny, input data pre-processing described\n        and posterior evaluations reported in this card.\n-   Misinformation and Misuse\n    -   VLMs can be misused to generate text that is false, misleading,\n        or harmful.\n    -   Guidelines are provided for responsible use with the model, see the\n        [Responsible Generative AI Toolkit][rai-toolkit].\n-   Transparency and Accountability:\n    -   This model card summarizes details on the models' architecture,\n        capabilities, limitations, and evaluation processes.\n    -   A responsibly developed open model offers the opportunity to\n        share innovation by making VLM technology accessible to developers and\n        researchers across the AI ecosystem.\n\nRisks identified and mitigations:\n\n-   **Perpetuation of biases**: It's encouraged to perform continuous\n    monitoring (using evaluation metrics, human review) and the exploration of\n    de-biasing techniques during model training, fine-tuning, and other use\n    cases.\n-   **Generation of harmful content**: Mechanisms and guidelines for content\n    safety are essential. Developers are encouraged to exercise caution and\n    implement appropriate content safety safeguards based on their specific\n    product policies and application use cases.\n-   **Misuse for malicious purposes**: Technical limitations and developer\n    and end-user education can help mitigate against malicious applications of\n    VLMs. Educational resources and reporting mechanisms for users to flag\n    misuse are provided. Prohibited uses of Gemma models are outlined in the\n    [Gemma Prohibited Use Policy][prohibited-use].\n-   **Privacy violations**: Models were trained on data filtered for removal\n    of certain personal information and other sensitive data. Developers are\n    encouraged to adhere to privacy regulations with privacy-preserving\n    techniques.\n\n### Benefits\n\nAt the time of release, this family of models provides high-performance open\nvision-language model implementations designed from the ground up for\nresponsible AI development compared to similarly sized models.\n\nUsing the benchmark evaluation metrics described in this document, these models\nhave shown to provide superior performance to other, comparably-sized open model\nalternatives.\n\n[g3-tech-report]: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19786\n[rai-toolkit]:

speech translation. Trained on 680k hours \nof labelled data, Whisper models demonstrate a strong ability to generalise to many datasets and domains **without** the need \nfor fine-tuning.\n\nWhisper was proposed in the paper [Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04356) \nby Alec Radford et al from OpenAI. The original code repository can be found [here](https://github.com/openai/whisper).\n\n**Disclaimer**: Content for this model card has partly been written by the Hugging Face team, and parts of it were \ncopied and pasted from the original model card.\n\n## Model details\n\nWhisper is a Transformer based encoder-decoder model, also referred to as a _sequence-to-sequence_ model. \nIt was trained on 680k hours of labelled speech data annotated using large-scale weak supervision. \n\nThe models were trained on either English-only data or multilingual data. The English-only models were trained \non the task of speech recognition. The multilingual models were trained on both speech recognition and speech \ntranslation. For speech recognition, the model predicts transcriptions in the *same* language as the audio. \nFor speech translation, the model predicts transcriptions to a *different* language to the audio.\n\nWhisper checkpoints come in five configurations of varying model sizes.\nThe smallest four are trained on either English-only or multilingual data.\nThe largest checkpoints are multilingual only. All ten of the pre-trained checkpoints \nare available on the [Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/models?search=openai/whisper). The \ncheckpoints are summarised in the following table with links to the models on the Hub:\n\n| Size     | Parameters | English-only                                         | Multilingual                                        |\n|----------|------------|------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|\n| tiny     | 39 M       | [\u2713](https://huggingface.co/openai/whisper-tiny.en)   | [\u2713](https://huggingface.co/openai/whisper-tiny)     |\n| base     | 74 M       | [\u2713](https://huggingface.co/openai/whisper-base.en)   | [\u2713](https://huggingface.co/openai/whisper-base)     |\n| small    | 244 M      | [\u2713](https://huggingface.co/openai/whisper-small.en)  | [\u2713](https://huggingface.co/openai/whisper-small)    |\n| medium   | 769 M      | [\u2713](https://huggingface.co/openai/whisper-medium.en) | [\u2713](https://huggingface.co/openai/whisper-medium)   |\n| large    | 1550 M     | x                                                    | [\u2713](https://huggingface.co/openai/whisper-large)    |\n| large-v2 | 1550 M     | x                                                    | [\u2713](https://huggingface.co/openai/whisper-large-v2) |\n\n# Usage\n\nTo transcribe audio samples, the model has to be used alongside a [`WhisperProcessor`](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/whisper#transformers.WhisperProcessor).\n\nThe `WhisperProcessor` is used to:\n1. Pre-process the audio inputs (converting them to log-Mel spectrograms for the model)\n2. Post-process the model outputs (converting them from tokens to text)\n\nThe model is informed of which task to perform (transcription or translation) by passing the appropriate \"context tokens\". These context tokens \nare a sequence of tokens that are given to the decoder at the start of the decoding process, and take the following order:\n1. The transcription always starts with the `<|startoftranscript|>` token\n2. The second token is the language token (e.g. `<|en|>` for English)\n3. The third token is the \"task token\". It can take one of two values: `<|transcribe|>` for speech recognition or `<|translate|>` for speech translation\n4. In addition, a `<|notimestamps|>` token is added if the model should not include timestamp prediction\n\nThus, a typical sequence of context tokens might look as follows:\n```\n<|startoftranscript|> <|en|> <|transcribe|> <|notimestamps|>\n```\nWhich tells the model to decode in English, under the task of speech recognition, and not to predict timestamps.\n\nThese tokens can either be forced or un-forced. If they are forced, the model is made to predict each token at \neach position. This allows one to control the output language and task for the Whisper model. If they are un-forced, \nthe Whisper model will automatically predict the output langauge and task itself.\n\nThe context tokens can be set accordingly:\n\n```python\nmodel.config.forced_decoder_ids = WhisperProcessor.get_decoder_prompt_ids(language=\"english\", task=\"transcribe\")\n```\n\nWhich forces the model to predict in English under the task of speech recognition.\n\n## Transcription\n\n### English to English \nIn this example, the context tokens are 'unforced', meaning the model automatically predicts the output language\n(English) and task (transcribe).\n\n```python\n>>> from transformers import WhisperProcessor, WhisperForConditionalGeneration\n>>> from datasets import load_dataset\n\n>>> # load model and processor\n>>> processor = WhisperProcessor.from_pretrained(\"openai/whisper-tiny\")\n>>> model = WhisperForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(\"openai/whisper-tiny\")\n>>> model.config.forced_decoder_ids = None\n\n>>> # load dummy dataset and read audio files\n>>> ds = load_dataset(\"hf-internal-testing/librispeech_asr_dummy\", \"clean\", split=\"validation\")\n>>> sample = ds[0][\"audio\"]\n>>> input_features = processor(sample[\"array\"], sampling_rate=sample[\"sampling_rate\"], return_tensors=\"pt\").input_features \n\n>>> # generate token ids\n>>> predicted_ids = model.generate(input_features)\n>>> # decode token ids to text\n>>> transcription = processor.batch_decode(predicted_ids, skip_special_tokens=False)\n['<|startoftranscript|><|en|><|transcribe|><|notimestamps|> Mr. Quilter is the apostle of the middle classes and we are glad to welcome his gospel.<|endoftext|>']\n\n>>> transcription = processor.batch_decode(predicted_ids, skip_special_tokens=True)\n[' Mr. Quilter is the apostle of the middle classes and we are glad to welcome his gospel.']\n```\nThe context tokens can be removed from the start of the transcription by setting `skip_special_tokens=True`.\n\n### French to French \nThe following example demonstrates French to French transcription by setting the decoder ids appropriately. \n\n```python\n>>> from transformers import WhisperProcessor, WhisperForConditionalGeneration\n>>> from datasets import Audio, load_dataset\n\n>>> # load model and processor\n>>> processor = WhisperProcessor.from_pretrained(\"openai/whisper-tiny\")\n>>> model = WhisperForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(\"openai/whisper-tiny\")\n>>> forced_decoder_ids = processor.get_decoder_prompt_ids(language=\"french\", task=\"transcribe\")\n\n>>> # load streaming dataset and read first audio sample\n>>> ds = load_dataset(\"common_voice\", \"fr\", split=\"test\", streaming=True)\n>>> ds = ds.cast_column(\"audio\", Audio(sampling_rate=16_000))\n>>> input_speech = next(iter(ds))[\"audio\"]\n>>> input_features = processor(input_speech[\"array\"], sampling_rate=input_speech[\"sampling_rate\"], return_tensors=\"pt\").input_features\n\n>>> # generate token ids\n>>> predicted_ids = model.generate(input_features, forced_decoder_ids=forced_decoder_ids)\n>>> # decode token ids to text\n>>> transcription = processor.batch_decode(predicted_ids)\n['<|startoftranscript|><|fr|><|transcribe|><|notimestamps|> Un vrai travail int\u00e9ressant va enfin \u00eatre men\u00e9 sur ce sujet.<|endoftext|>']\n\n>>> transcription = processor.batch_decode(predicted_ids, skip_special_tokens=True)\n[' Un vrai travail int\u00e9ressant va enfin \u00eatre men\u00e9 sur ce sujet.']\n```\n\n## Translation \nSetting the task to \"translate\" forces the Whisper model to perform speech translation.\n\n### French to English\n\n```python\n>>> from transformers import WhisperProcessor, WhisperForConditionalGeneration\n>>> from datasets import Audio, load_dataset\n\n>>> # load model and processor\n>>> processor = WhisperProcessor.from_pretrained(\"openai/whisper-tiny\")\n>>> model = WhisperForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(\"openai/whisper-tiny\")\n>>> forced_decoder_ids = processor.get_decoder_prompt_ids(language=\"french\", task=\"translate\")\n\n>>> # load streaming dataset and read first audio sample\n>>> ds = load_dataset(\"common_voice\", \"fr\", split=\"test\", streaming=True)\n>>> ds = ds.cast_column(\"audio\", Audio(sampling_rate=16_000))\n>>> input_speech = next(iter(ds))[\"audio\"]\n>>> input_features = processor(input_speech[\"array\"], sampling_rate=input_speech[\"sampling_rate\"], return_tensors=\"pt\").input_features\n\n>>> # generate token ids\n>>> predicted_ids = model.generate(input_features, forced_decoder_ids=forced_decoder_ids)\n>>> # decode token ids to text\n>>> transcription = processor.batch_decode(predicted_ids, skip_special_tokens=True)\n[' A very interesting work, we will finally be given on this subject.']\n```\n\n## Evaluation\n\nThis code snippet shows how to evaluate Whisper Tiny on [LibriSpeech test-clean](https://huggingface.co/datasets/librispeech_asr):\n \n```python\n>>> from datasets import load_dataset\n>>> from transformers import WhisperForConditionalGeneration, WhisperProcessor\n>>> import torch\n>>> from evaluate import load\n\n>>> librispeech_test_clean = load_dataset(\"librispeech_asr\", \"clean\", split=\"test\")\n\n>>> processor = WhisperProcessor.from_pretrained(\"openai/whisper-tiny\")\n>>> model = WhisperForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(\"openai/whisper-tiny\").to(\"cuda\")\n\n>>> def map_to_pred(batch):\n>>>     audio = batch[\"audio\"]\n>>>     input_features = processor(audio[\"array\"], sampling_rate=audio[\"sampling_rate\"], return_tensors=\"pt\").input_features\n>>>     batch[\"reference\"] = processor.tokenizer._normalize(batch['text'])\n>>> \n>>>     with torch.no_grad():\n>>>         predicted_ids = model.generate(input_features.to(\"cuda\"))[0]\n>>>     transcription = processor.decode(predicted_ids)\n>>>     batch[\"prediction\"] = processor.tokenizer._normalize(transcription)\n>>>     return batch\n\n>>> result = librispeech_test_clean.map(map_to_pred)\n\n>>> wer = load(\"wer\")\n>>> print(100 * wer.compute(references=result[\"reference\"], predictions=result[\"prediction\"]))\n7.547098647858638\n```\n\n## Long-Form Transcription\n\nThe Whisper model is intrinsically designed to work on audio samples of up to 30s in duration. However, by using a chunking \nalgorithm, it can be used to transcribe audio samples of up to arbitrary length. This is possible through Transformers \n[`pipeline`](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main_classes/pipelines#transformers.AutomaticSpeechRecognitionPipeline) \nmethod. Chunking is enabled by setting `chunk_length_s=30` when instantiating the pipeline. With chunking enabled, the pipeline \ncan be run with batched inference. It can also be extended to predict sequence level timestamps by passing `return_timestamps=True`:\n\n```python\n>>> import torch\n>>> from transformers import pipeline\n>>> from datasets import load_dataset\n\n>>> device = \"cuda:0\" if torch.cuda.is_available() else \"cpu\"\n\n>>> pipe = pipeline(\n>>>   \"automatic-speech-recognition\",\n>>>   model=\"openai/whisper-tiny\",\n>>>   chunk_length_s=30,\n>>>   device=device,\n>>> )\n\n>>> ds = load_dataset(\"hf-internal-testing/librispeech_asr_dummy\", \"clean\", split=\"validation\")\n>>> sample = ds[0][\"audio\"]\n\n>>> prediction = pipe(sample.copy(), batch_size=8)[\"text\"]\n\" Mr. Quilter is the apostle of the middle classes, and we are glad to welcome his gospel.\"\n\n>>> # we can also return timestamps for the predictions\n>>> prediction = pipe(sample.copy(), batch_size=8, return_timestamps=True)[\"chunks\"]\n[{'text': ' Mr. Quilter is the apostle of the middle classes and we are glad to welcome his gospel.',\n  'timestamp': (0.0, 5.44)}]\n```\n\nRefer to the blog post [ASR Chunking](https://huggingface.co/blog/asr-chunking) for more details on the chunking algorithm.\n\n## Fine-Tuning\n\nThe pre-trained Whisper model demonstrates a strong ability to generalise to different datasets and domains. However, \nits predictive capabilities can be improved further for certain languages and tasks through *fine-tuning*. The blog \npost [Fine-Tune Whisper with \ud83e\udd17 Transformers](https://huggingface.co/blog/fine-tune-whisper) provides a step-by-step \nguide to fine-tuning the Whisper model with as little as 5 hours of labelled data.\n\n### Evaluated Use\n\nThe primary intended users of these models are AI researchers studying robustness, generalization, capabilities, biases, and constraints of the current model. However, Whisper is also potentially quite useful as an ASR solution for developers, especially for English speech recognition. We recognize that once models are released, it is impossible to restrict access to only \u201cintended\u201d uses or to draw reasonable guidelines around what is or is not research.\n\nThe models are primarily trained and evaluated on ASR and speech translation to English tasks. They show strong ASR results in ~10 languages. They may exhibit additional capabilities, particularly if fine-tuned on certain tasks like voice activity detection, speaker classification, or speaker diarization but have not been robustly evaluated in these areas. We strongly recommend that users perform robust evaluations of the models in a particular context and domain before deploying them.\n\nIn particular, we caution against using Whisper models to transcribe recordings of individuals taken without their consent or purporting to use these models for any kind of subjective classification. We recommend against use in high-risk domains like decision-making contexts, where flaws in accuracy can lead to pronounced flaws in outcomes. The models are intended to transcribe and translate speech, use of the model for classification is not only not evaluated but also not appropriate, particularly to infer human attributes.\n\n\n## Training Data\n\nThe models are trained on 680,000 hours of audio and the corresponding transcripts collected from the internet. 65% of this data (or 438,000 hours) represents English-language audio and matched English transcripts, roughly 18% (or 126,000 hours) represents non-English audio and English transcripts, while the final 17% (or 117,000 hours) represents non-English audio and the corresponding transcript. This non-English data represents 98 different languages. \n\nAs discussed in [the accompanying paper](https://cdn.openai.com/papers/whisper.pdf), we see that performance on transcription in a given language is directly correlated with the amount of training data we employ in that language.\n\n\n## Performance and Limitations\n\nOur studies show that, over many existing ASR systems, the models exhibit improved robustness to accents, background noise, technical language, as well as zero shot translation from multiple languages into English; and that accuracy on speech recognition and translation is near the state-of-the-art level. \n\nHowever, because the models are trained in a weakly supervised manner using large-scale noisy data, the predictions may include texts that are not actually spoken in the audio input (i.e. hallucination). We hypothesize that this happens because, given their general knowledge of language, the models combine trying to predict the next word in audio with trying to transcribe the audio itself.\n\nOur models perform unevenly across languages, and we observe lower accuracy on low-resource and/or low-discoverability languages or languages where we have less training data. The models also exhibit disparate performance on different accents and dialects of particular languages, which may include higher word error rate across speakers of different genders, races, ages, or other demographic criteria. Our full evaluation results are presented in [the paper accompanying this release](https://cdn.openai.com/papers/whisper.pdf). \n\nIn addition, the sequence-to-sequence architecture of the model makes it prone to generating repetitive texts, which can be mitigated to some degree by beam search and temperature scheduling but not perfectly. Further analysis on these limitations are provided in [the paper](https://cdn.openai.com/papers/whisper.pdf). It is likely that this behavior and hallucinations may be worse on lower-resource and/or lower-discoverability languages.\n\n\n## Broader Implications\n\nWe anticipate that Whisper models\u2019 transcription capabilities may be used for improving accessibility tools. While Whisper models cannot be used for real-time transcription out of the box \u2013 their speed and size suggest that others may be able to build applications on top of them that allow for near-real-time speech recognition and translation. The real value of beneficial applications built on top of Whisper models suggests that the disparate performance of these models may have real economic implications.\n\nThere are also potential dual use concerns that come with releasing Whisper. While we hope the technology will be used primarily for beneficial purposes, making ASR technology more accessible could enable more actors to build capable surveillance technologies or scale up existing surveillance efforts, as the speed and accuracy allow for affordable automatic transcription and translation of large volumes of audio communication. Moreover, these models may have some capabilities to recognize specific individuals out of the box, which in turn presents safety concerns related both to dual use and disparate performance. In practice, we expect that the cost of transcription is not the limiting factor of scaling up surveillance projects.\n\n\n### BibTeX entry and citation info\n```bibtex\n@misc{radford2022whisper,\n  doi = {10.48550/ARXIV.2212.04356},\n  url = {https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04356},\n  author = {Radford, Alec and Kim, Jong Wook and Xu, Tao and Brockman, Greg and McLeavey, Christine and Sutskever, Ilya},\n  title = {Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision},\n  publisher = {arXiv},\n  year = {2022},\n  copyright = {arXiv.org perpetual, non-exclusive license}\n}\n```\n", "files": [{"path": ".gitattributes", "size": 1438}, {"path": "README.md", "size": 19787}, {"path": "added_tokens.json", "size": 34604}, {"path": "config.json", "size": 1983}, {"path": "flax_model.msgpack", "size": 151048591}, {"path": "generation_config.json", "size": 3747}, {"path": "merges.txt", "size": 493869}, {"path": "model.safetensors", "size": 151061672}, {"path": "normalizer.json", "size": 52666}, {"path": "preprocessor_config.json", "size": 184990}, {"path": "pytorch_model.bin", "size": 151095027}, {"path": "special_tokens_map.json", "size": 2194}, {"path": "tf_model.h5", "size": 151253960}, {"path": "tokenizer.json", "size": 2480466}, {"path": "tokenizer_config.json", "size": 282683}, {"path": "vocab.json", "size": 835550}], "size": 608853227, "datasets": [], "github_links": ["https://github.com/openai/whisper"], "_source": {"fetched_at": 1758918107.3509269, "last_modified": "2024-02-29T10:57:33+00:00"}}, "fetched_at": 1758918107.3509269}, "model:google-bert/bert-base-uncased": {"payload": {"url": "https://huggingface.co/google-bert/bert-base-uncased", "repo_id": "google-bert/bert-base-uncased", "repo_type": "model", "license": "apache-2.0", "downloads": 55171860, "likes": 2417, "last_modified": "2024-02-19T11:06:12+00:00", "tags": ["transformers", "pytorch", "tf", "jax", "rust", "coreml", "onnx", "safetensors", "bert", "fill-mask", "exbert", "en", "dataset:bookcorpus", "dataset:wikipedia", "arxiv:1810.04805", "license:apache-2.0", "autotrain_compatible", "endpoints_compatible", "region:us"], "pipeline_tag": "fill-mask", "card_yaml": "datasets:\n- bookcorpus\n- wikipedia\nlanguage: en\nlicense: apache-2.0\ntags:\n- exbert", "readme_text": "\n# BERT base model (uncased)\n\nPretrained model on English language using a masked language modeling (MLM) objective.

This means it\nwas pretrained on the raw texts only, with no humans labeling them in any way (which is why it can use lots of\npublicly available data) with an automatic process to generate inputs and labels from those texts. More precisely, it\nwas pretrained with two objectives:\n\n- Masked language modeling (MLM): taking a sentence, the model randomly masks 15% of the words in the input then run\n  the entire masked sentence through the model and has to predict the masked words. This is different from traditional\n  recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that usually see the words one after the other, or from autoregressive models like\n  GPT which internally masks the future tokens. It allows the model to learn a bidirectional representation of the\n  sentence.\n- Next sentence prediction (NSP): the models concatenates two masked sentences as inputs during pretraining. Sometimes\n  they correspond to sentences that were next to each other in the original text, sometimes not. The model then has to\n  predict if the two sentences were following each other or not.\n\nThis way, the model learns an inner representation of the English language that can then be used to extract features\nuseful for downstream tasks: if you have a dataset of labeled sentences, for instance, you can train a standard\nclassifier using the features produced by the BERT model as inputs.\n\n## Model variations\n\nBERT has originally been released in base and large variations, for cased and uncased input text. The uncased models also strips out an accent markers.  \nChinese and multilingual uncased and cased versions followed shortly after.  \nModified preprocessing with whole word masking has replaced subpiece masking in a following work, with the release of two models.  \nOther 24 smaller models are released afterward.  \n\nThe detailed release history can be found on the [google-research/bert readme](https://github.com/google-research/bert/blob/master/README.md) on github.\n\n| Model | #params | Language |\n|------------------------|--------------------------------|-------|\n| [`bert-base-uncased`](https://huggingface.co/bert-base-uncased) | 110M   | English |\n| [`bert-large-uncased`](https://huggingface.co/bert-large-uncased)              | 340M    | English | sub \n| [`bert-base-cased`](https://huggingface.co/bert-base-cased)        | 110M    | English |\n| [`bert-large-cased`](https://huggingface.co/bert-large-cased) | 340M    |  English |\n| [`bert-base-chinese`](https://huggingface.co/bert-base-chinese) | 110M    | Chinese |\n| [`bert-base-multilingual-cased`](https://huggingface.co/bert-base-multilingual-cased) | 110M | Multiple |\n| [`bert-large-uncased-whole-word-masking`](https://huggingface.co/bert-large-uncased-whole-word-masking) | 340M | English |\n| [`bert-large-cased-whole-word-masking`](https://huggingface.co/bert-large-cased-whole-word-masking) | 340M | English |\n\n## Intended uses & limitations\n\nYou can use the raw model for either masked language modeling or next sentence prediction, but it's mostly intended to\nbe fine-tuned on a downstream task. See the [model hub](https://huggingface.co/models?filter=bert) to look for\nfine-tuned versions of a task that interests you.\n\nNote that this model is primarily aimed at being fine-tuned on tasks that use the whole sentence (potentially masked)\nto make decisions, such as sequence classification, token classification or question answering. For tasks such as text\ngeneration you should look at model like GPT2.\n\n### How to use\n\nYou can use this model directly with a pipeline for masked language modeling:\n\n```python\n>>> from transformers import pipeline\n>>> unmasker = pipeline('fill-mask', model='bert-base-uncased')\n>>> unmasker(\"Hello I'm a [MASK] model.\")\n\n[{'sequence': \"[CLS] hello i'm a fashion model. [SEP]\",\n  'score': 0.1073106899857521,\n  'token': 4827,\n  'token_str': 'fashion'},\n {'sequence': \"[CLS] hello i'm a role model. [SEP]\",\n  'score': 0.08774490654468536,\n  'token': 2535,\n  'token_str': 'role'},\n {'sequence': \"[CLS] hello i'm a new model. [SEP]\",\n  'score': 0.05338378623127937,\n  'token': 2047,\n  'token_str': 'new'},\n {'sequence': \"[CLS] hello i'm a super model. [SEP]\",\n  'score': 0.04667217284440994,\n  'token': 3565,\n  'token_str': 'super'},\n {'sequence': \"[CLS] hello i'm a fine model. [SEP]\",\n  'score': 0.027095865458250046,\n  'token': 2986,\n  'token_str': 'fine'}]\n```\n\nHere is how to use this model to get the features of a given text in PyTorch:\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import BertTokenizer, BertModel\ntokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')\nmodel = BertModel.from_pretrained(\"bert-base-uncased\")\ntext = \"Replace me by any text you'd like.\"\nencoded_input = tokenizer(text, return_tensors='pt')\noutput = model(**encoded_input)\n```\n\nand in TensorFlow:\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import BertTokenizer, TFBertModel\ntokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')\nmodel = TFBertModel.from_pretrained(\"bert-base-uncased\")\ntext = \"Replace me by any text you'd like.\"\nencoded_input = tokenizer(text, return_tensors='tf')\noutput = model(encoded_input)\n```\n\n### Limitations and bias\n\nEven if the training data used for this model could be characterized as fairly neutral, this model can have biased\npredictions:\n\n```python\n>>> from transformers import pipeline\n>>> unmasker = pipeline('fill-mask', model='bert-base-uncased')\n>>> unmasker(\"The man worked as a [MASK].\")\n\n[{'sequence': '[CLS] the man worked as a carpenter. [SEP]',\n  'score': 0.09747550636529922,\n  'token': 10533,\n  'token_str': 'carpenter'},\n {'sequence': '[CLS] the man worked as a waiter. [SEP]',\n  'score': 0.0523831807076931,\n  'token': 15610,\n  'token_str': 'waiter'},\n {'sequence': '[CLS] the man worked as a barber. [SEP]',\n  'score': 0.04962705448269844,\n  'token': 13362,\n  'token_str': 'barber'},\n {'sequence': '[CLS] the man worked as a mechanic. [SEP]',\n  'score': 0.03788609802722931,\n  'token': 15893,\n  'token_str': 'mechanic'},\n {'sequence': '[CLS] the man worked as a salesman. [SEP]',\n  'score': 0.037680890411138535,\n  'token': 18968,\n  'token_str': 'salesman'}]\n\n>>> unmasker(\"The woman worked as a [MASK].\")\n\n[{'sequence': '[CLS] the woman worked as a nurse. [SEP]',\n  'score': 0.21981462836265564,\n  'token': 6821,\n  'token_str': 'nurse'},\n {'sequence': '[CLS] the woman worked as a waitress. [SEP]',\n  'score': 0.1597415804862976,\n  'token': 13877,\n  'token_str': 'waitress'},\n {'sequence': '[CLS] the woman worked as a maid. [SEP]',\n  'score': 0.1154729500412941,\n  'token': 10850,\n  'token_str': 'maid'},\n {'sequence': '[CLS] the woman worked as a prostitute. [SEP]',\n  'score': 0.037968918681144714,\n  'token': 19215,\n  'token_str': 'prostitute'},\n {'sequence': '[CLS] the woman worked as a cook. [SEP]',\n  'score': 0.03042375110089779,\n  'token': 5660,\n  'token_str': 'cook'}]\n```\n\nThis bias will also affect all fine-tuned versions of this model.\n\n## Training data\n\nThe BERT model was pretrained on [BookCorpus](https://yknzhu.wixsite.com/mbweb), a dataset consisting of 11,038\nunpublished books and [English Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Wikipedia) (excluding lists, tables and\nheaders).\n\n## Training procedure\n\n### Preprocessing\n\nThe texts are lowercased and tokenized using WordPiece and a vocabulary size of 30,000. The inputs of the model are\nthen of the form:\n\n```\n[CLS] Sentence A [SEP] Sentence B [SEP]\n```\n\nWith probability 0.5, sentence A and sentence B correspond to two consecutive sentences in the original corpus, and in\nthe other cases, it's another random sentence in the corpus. Note that what is considered a sentence here is a\nconsecutive span of text usually longer than a single sentence. The only constrain is that the result with the two\n\"sentences\" has a combined length of less than 512 tokens.\n\nThe details of the masking procedure for each sentence are the following:\n- 15% of the tokens are masked.\n- In 80% of the cases, the masked tokens are replaced by `[MASK]`.\n- In 10% of the cases, the masked tokens are replaced by a random token (different) from the one they replace.\n- In the 10% remaining cases, the masked tokens are left as is.\n\n### Pretraining\n\nThe model was trained on 4 cloud TPUs in Pod configuration (16 TPU chips total) for one million steps with a batch size\nof 256. The sequence length was limited to 128 tokens for 90% of the steps and 512 for the remaining 10%. The optimizer\nused is Adam with a learning rate of 1e-4, \\\\(\\beta_{1} = 0.9\\\\) and \\\\(\\beta_{2} = 0.999\\\\), a weight decay of 0.01,\nlearning rate warmup for 10,000 steps and linear decay of the learning rate after.\n\n## Evaluation results\n\nWhen fine-tuned on downstream tasks, this model achieves the following results:\n\nGlue test results:\n\n| Task | MNLI-(m/mm) | QQP  | QNLI | SST-2 | CoLA | STS-B | MRPC | RTE  | Average |\n|:----:|:-----------:|:----:|:----:|:-----:|:----:|:-----:|:----:|:----:|:-------:|\n|      | 84.6/83.4   | 71.2 | 90.5 | 93.5  | 52.1 | 85.8  | 88.9 | 66.4 | 79.6    |\n\n\n### BibTeX entry and citation info\n\n```bibtex\n@article{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1810-04805,\n  author    = {Jacob Devlin and\n               Ming{-}Wei Chang and\n               Kenton Lee and\n               Kristina Toutanova},\n  title     = {{BERT:} Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language\n               Understanding},\n  journal   = {CoRR},\n  volume    = {abs/1810.04805},\n  year      = {2018},\n  url       = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805},\n  archivePrefix = {arXiv},\n  eprint    = {1810.04805},\n  timestamp = {Tue, 30 Oct 2018 20:39:56 +0100},\n  biburl    = {https://dblp.org/rec/journals/corr/abs-1810-04805.bib},\n  bibsource = {dblp computer science bibliography, https://dblp.org}\n}\n```\n\n<a href=\"https://huggingface.co/exbert/?model=bert-base-uncased\">\n\t<img width=\"300px\" src=\"https://cdn-media.huggingface.co/exbert/button.png\">\n</a>\n", "files": [{"path": ".gitattributes", "size": 491}, {"path": "LICENSE", "size": 11356}, {"path": "README.md", "size": 10517}, {"path": "config.json", "size": 570}, {"path": "coreml/fill-mask/float32_model.mlpackage/Data/com.apple.CoreML/model.mlmodel", "size": 164911}, {"path": "coreml/fill-mask/float32_model.mlpackage/Data/com.apple.CoreML/weights/weight.bin", "size": 531833856}, {"path": "coreml/fill-mask/float32_model.mlpackage/Manifest.json", "size": 617}, {"path": "flax_model.msgpack", "size": 438064459}, {"path": "model.onnx", "size": 532091246}, {"path": "model.safetensors", "size": 440449768}, {"path": "pytorch_model.bin", "size": 440473133}, {"path": "rust_model.ot", "size": 534240408}, {"path": "tf_model.h5", "size": 536063208}, {"path": "tokenizer.json", "size": 466062}, {"path": "tokenizer_config.json", "size": 48}, {"path": "vocab.txt", "size": 231508}], "size": 3454102158, "datasets": ["bookcorpus", "wikipedia"], "github_links": ["https://github.com/google-research/bert", "https://github.com/google-research/bert/blob/master/README.md"], "_source": {"fetched_at": 1758918332.5844457, "last_modified": "2024-02-19T11:06:12+00:00"}}, "fetched_at": 1758918332.5844457}, "model:parvk11/audience_classifier_model": {"payload": {"url": "https://huggingface.co/parvk11/audience_classifier_model", "repo_id": "parvk11/audience_classifier_model", "repo_type": "model", "license": null, "downloads": 49, "likes": 0, "last_modified": "2025-04-25T04:49:24+00:00", "tags": ["transformers", "pytorch", "distilbert", "text-classification", "arxiv:1910.09700", "autotrain_compatible", "endpoints_compatible", "region:us"], "pipeline_tag": "text-classification", "card_yaml": "library_name: transformers\ntags: []", "readme_text": "\n# Model Card for Model ID\n\n<!-- Provide a quick summary of what the model is/does. -->\n\n\n\n## Model Details\n\n### Model Description\n\n<!-- Provide a longer summary of what this model is. -->\n\nThis is the model card of a \ud83e\udd17 transformers model that has been pushed on the Hub.
