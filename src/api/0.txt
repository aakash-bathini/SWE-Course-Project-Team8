API rules

Add the API's and similar processes in this folder, each different kind should
have its own file, and be black box enough to just call the relevant endpoint.

prep_eval_context.py is basically a preprocess for every URL, it will call all the API's
so we get all the data for a URL like the TYPE, hugging face data, github data, and
the cloned repo.

Then the eval_context is what each metric actually runs,
I believe this abstracts the data from the metrics, and makes it easier to work on
them seperately. And this preprocessing will make metrics easier to write.
