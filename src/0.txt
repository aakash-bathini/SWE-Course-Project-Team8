The flow for URL so far is

URL -> Prep -> Metrics -> Score -> Output

URL: Starts with the CLI input

Prep: A step i've added to abstract repetetive API calls, and create a ground 
truth for each URL. Basically each URL must be prepped before sending for metric
analysis.

Metrics: Each Metric is coded in its own file, and added to the registry which 
is actually used in the pipeline. Then the orchestrator calls them in parallell.

Score: Scores the results using the weights

Output: Handles output
